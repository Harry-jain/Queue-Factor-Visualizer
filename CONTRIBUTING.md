## üìö DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Code Documentation

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the utilization percentage of processing units
 * @param processingUnits - Array of processing units to analyze
 * @param totalTime - Total simulation time in ticks
 * @returns Utilization percentage (0-100)
 * @example
 * const utilization = calculateUtilization(units, 1000);
 */
export const calculateUtilization = (
  processingUnits: ProcessingUnit[],
  totalTime: number
): number => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### Component Documentation

```typescript
/**
 * TaskQueueVisualizer Component
 * 
 * Displays the current state of the task queue with real-time updates.
 * Shows task status, scheduling algorithm, and queue statistics.
 * 
 * @param tasks - Array of tasks in the queue
 * @param algorithm - Current scheduling algorithm
 * @param onTaskClick - Callback when a task is clicked
 * @param isRunning - Whether simulation is currently running
 */
interface TaskQueueVisualizerProps {
  tasks: Task[];
  algorithm: SchedulingAlgorithm;
  onTaskClick: (task: Task) => void;
  isRunning: boolean;
